# JaxFrames Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

JaxFrames is an ambitious project to create a pandas-compatible DataFrame library that runs natively on TPUs using JAX. This plan breaks down the implementation into 6 manageable stages, progressing from basic data structures to a fully-featured, distributed, query-optimized DataFrame library.

**Core Vision**: Match pandas API semantics while leveraging JAX's functional programming model, immutability, and TPU-native execution for unprecedented performance on large-scale data operations.

**Current Status (December 2024)**:
- ✅ **Stage 0**: Foundation - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Stage 1**: Core Data Structures with Auto-JIT - COMPLETE (10-25,000x speedups)
- ✅ **Stage 2**: Multi-Device Foundation - COMPLETE (TPU-verified!)
- 🚀 **Stage 3**: Core Parallel Algorithms - NEXT
- Total Progress: ~12 weeks completed of 42 weeks

## Project Goals

1. **API Compatibility**: Match pandas API semantics while respecting JAX's functional constraints
2. **Validation**: Extensive testing against pandas to ensure correctness
3. **Performance**: Leverage TPU parallelism for massive performance gains
4. **Scalability**: Handle datasets larger than single-device memory through distribution
5. **Developer Experience**: Use UV for modern Python package management

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a 4-layer architecture:

1. **API Layer**: User-facing JaxFrame/JaxSeries classes with pandas-like interface
2. **Logical Plan Layer**: Query representation and optimization engine  
3. **Physical Execution Layer**: JAX code generation and shard_map orchestration
4. **Distributed Algorithms Layer**: Core parallel primitives (sort, groupby, joins)

## Data Type Strategy

JaxFrames supports a comprehensive range of data types to maintain pandas compatibility:

### Core JAX-Native Types
- **Numerical**: `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`, `bool` (stored as JAX arrays)
- **Complex**: `complex64`, `complex128` for scientific computing

### Python Object Types  
- **Strings**: Stored as object arrays with JAX-compatible operations where possible
- **Lists/Sequences**: Variable-length sequences stored as ragged arrays or object arrays
- **Dictionaries**: Nested dictionaries stored as structured object arrays
- **Mixed Types**: Heterogeneous columns handled via object dtype with fallback strategies

### Implementation Strategy
- **Homogeneous columns**: Use JAX arrays directly for maximum performance
- **Heterogeneous columns**: Use object arrays with JAX operations on homogeneous subsets
- **String operations**: Implement JAX-compatible string kernels for common operations
- **Nested data**: Provide `.explode()`, `.json_normalize()` and accessor methods
- **Type conversion**: Seamless conversion between JAX and object types as needed

- TPU testing requires exclusive access (one process at a time)

### Stage 3: Core Parallel Algorithms (12 weeks) - NEXT

**Objective**: Implement the foundational parallel algorithms that enable complex operations

**Updated Considerations**:
- TPU access confirmed working - can test at scale
- Build on Stage 2's distributed infrastructure
- Consider TPU-specific optimizations for sorting algorithms

**Priority 1: Massively Parallel Radix Sort (6 weeks)**

This is the cornerstone algorithm that enables efficient groupby and join operations.

```python
def parallel_radix_sort(arr: jax.Array, mesh: DeviceMesh) -> jax.Array:
    """
    Distributed radix sort implementation using JAX primitives
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Local histogram calculation (embarrassingly parallel)
    2. Global histogram aggregation (jax.lax.psum)
    3. Global offset calculation (prefix sum/scan)
    4. Data scatter/reordering (jax.lax.all_to_all)
    """
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- 8-bit radix passes for 64-bit keys
- Local histogram computation on each device
- Global prefix sum to determine target positions
- `all_to_all` collective for data redistribution
- Handle multiple sort keys (compound sorting)

**Priority 2: Sort-Based GroupBy (4 weeks)**

```python
def groupby_agg(df: JaxFrame, by: str, agg_func: str) -> JaxFrame:
    """
    Implementation:
    1. Sort entire DataFrame by group key
    2. Identify segment boundaries (adjacent key comparison)
    3. Apply jax.ops.segment_sum/max/min for aggregation
    """
```

**Priority 3: Parallel Sort-Merge Join (2 weeks)**

```python
def merge_join(left: JaxFrame, right: JaxFrame, on: str) -> JaxFrame:
    """
    Implementation:
    1. Sort both DataFrames by join key
    2. Optional: Align key ranges across devices
    3. Local merge on each device (embarrassingly parallel)
    """
```

- GroupBy operations show significant speedup over pandas
- Joins scale efficiently with dataset size and device count
- All operations maintain correctness vs pandas reference

### Stage 4: Lazy Execution Engine (8 weeks)

**Objective**: Transform from eager execution to query-optimized lazy execution

**Updated Considerations**:
- Current eager execution is performant with auto-JIT
- Lazy execution can build on existing JIT infrastructure
- Consider TPU memory constraints for query optimization

**Key Components**:

1. **Logical Plan Representation**:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class LogicalPlan:
       op_type: str  # 'scan', 'filter', 'project', 'aggregate', 'join'
       inputs: List[LogicalPlan]
       params: Dict[str, Any]
       schema: Schema  # Column names and types
   ```

2. **Expression System**:
   ```python
   # User writes: df.filter(col('a') > col('b') + 2)
   # Creates expression tree for lazy evaluation
   expr = GreaterThan(
       left=Column('a'),
       right=Add(Column('b'), Literal(2))
   )
   ```

3. **Query Optimizer**:
   - **Predicate Pushdown**: Move filters close to data sources
   - **Projection Pushdown**: Only read required columns
   - **Constant Folding**: Pre-compute constant expressions
   - **Operation Fusion**: Combine compatible operations

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Translate optimized logical plan to JAX function
   - Generate appropriate `shard_map` wrappers
   - Handle sharding requirements and communication patterns

**API Transformation**:
```python
# Before (eager): immediate execution
result = df.filter(df['a'] > 0).groupby('b').sum()

# After (lazy): builds query plan
query = df.filter(df['a'] > 0).groupby('b').sum()
result = query.collect()  # Triggers optimization and execution
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Query optimization provides 20%+ performance improvements
- Complex queries (multiple filters, joins, aggregations) work correctly

   # Efficient writing
   df.to_parquet('gs://bucket/output/', partition_cols=['date'])
   ```

3. **Interoperability**:
   ```python
   # Convert to/from JAX arrays
   arrays = df.to_jax()  # Dict[str, jax.Array]
   df = jf.from_jax(arrays, sharding=...)
   
   # Pandas compatibility
   df_pandas = df.to_pandas()  # Gather to single device
