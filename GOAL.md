JaxFrame: An Architectural Blueprint for a Scalable DataFrame Library on TPUs with JAX
Section 1: Foundational Principles: A JAX-Native Approach to DataFrames
The development of a high-performance DataFrame library for modern accelerator architectures demands a design philosophy that is deeply synergistic with the underlying computational framework. For a library targeting Google's TPUs, this framework is JAX. JAX's design, centered on pure functions, immutability, and composable transformations, is not a set of constraints to be circumvented, but rather a powerful foundation upon which a uniquely robust, predictable, and optimizable DataFrame architecture can be constructed. This section outlines the three foundational principles that will govern the design of JaxFrame, demonstrating how embracing JAX's paradigm naturally leads to an architecture that is both performant and scalable.
1.1 The Immutable, Functional Paradigm: Embracing JAX's Core Philosophy
The most defining characteristic of JAX is its adherence to a functional programming model. JAX transformations and its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, XLA, are designed to operate on Python functions that are functionally pure. A pure function guarantees that for a given input, it will always produce the same output and will have no observable side effects, such as modifying global state or performing I/O. This purity is essential for the complex program analysis and transformations that enable JAX's high performance, including automatic differentiation, vectorization, and parallelization.
Consequently, the core principle of JaxFrame must be that all of its operations are also functionally pure. This has profound implications for the API design. While the library will aim for syntactic familiarity with the pandas API, its semantics will be fundamentally different. In pandas, many operations can modify a DataFrame in-place. In JaxFrame, all data structures will be immutable, mirroring the immutability of JAX arrays themselves. Any operation that logically "modifies" a DataFrame—such as adding a column, filtering rows, or sorting—will return a new JaxFrame instance containing the result. The original JaxFrame will remain unchanged. This out-of-place operational model is directly analogous to JAX's own array update syntax, which uses the .at[...].set(...) method to return a modified copy of an array rather than altering the original.
This design choice, while a departure from the mutable patterns of pandas, offers significant advantages in a parallel computing context. Immutability eliminates entire classes of bugs related to race conditions and ambiguous program state that can arise when multiple workers attempt to modify a shared data structure. It makes the flow of data explicit and the behavior of programs deterministic, which is a prerequisite for reliable execution across hundreds or thousands of TPU cores. Furthermore, any form of state, such as the keys used for pseudo-random number generation, must be managed explicitly. Following the standard JAX pattern, functions requiring randomness will take a PRNG key as an explicit argument, and any subsequent random operations will require the user to split that key, ensuring full reproducibility of all computations.
1.2 The DataFrame as a JAX PyTree: Unlocking JAX Transformations
For a custom data structure to become a first-class citizen within the JAX ecosystem, it must be recognizable to JAX's system of function transformations. The mechanism for this integration is the PyTree abstraction. A PyTree is a container of leaf elements (like arrays) and other PyTrees, with standard Python lists, tuples, and dictionaries being registered as PyTree nodes by default. The single most critical architectural decision for JaxFrame is that its core data structures, JaxFrame and JaxSeries, will be implemented as custom Python classes registered as PyTree nodes.
This registration is accomplished by providing two functions to JAX's tree_util.register_pytree_node: a "flatten" function and an "unflatten" function.
 * tree_flatten: This function will define how to deconstruct a JaxFrame instance into its constituent parts. It will return a tuple containing two elements:
   * A list of "leaf" data: These are the dynamic, array-like components that JAX transformations will operate on. For a JaxFrame, this will be a list of the JAX arrays that back each of its columns.
   * A collection of "auxiliary" data: These are the static, non-array components that define the structure of the container but are not transformed by JAX. For a JaxFrame, this will include metadata such as the column names, their order, and any index information.
 * tree_unflatten: This function defines the inverse operation. It takes the auxiliary data and a list of (potentially transformed) leaves and reconstructs a JaxFrame instance.
By providing these two functions, JaxFrame objects can be seamlessly passed as arguments to and returned as results from any JAX transformation, including jax.jit, jax.vmap, jax.grad, and, most importantly for this project, jax.shard_map. This deep integration means that the entire DataFrame, not just its constituent arrays, can be JIT-compiled and distributed across devices. The user can write code that manipulates JaxFrame objects, and JAX will automatically trace the operations on the underlying arrays, enabling end-to-end optimization of complex data processing pipelines.
1.3 A Lazy Execution Engine with Query Optimization
Executing DataFrame operations eagerly, one by one, is inherently inefficient in a JIT-compiled framework like JAX. Each operation would trigger a separate, small compilation, incurring significant overhead and preventing the compiler from performing holistic, cross-operation optimizations. The optimal approach, which has become a cornerstone of modern high-performance DataFrame libraries like Polars, is a lazy execution model.
The architecture of JaxFrame will be built around such a lazy engine. When a user calls a method on a JaxFrame object (e.g., df.filter(...)), the operation will not be executed immediately. Instead, a node representing this operation will be appended to a logical plan. This logical plan is an intermediate representation (IR) of the entire sequence of desired computations—a tree-like structure that describes what the user wants to do, but not how to do it.
Execution is deferred until the user explicitly requests a result, for instance by calling a .collect() or .compute() method. This deferral is the key to performance. Before execution, the complete logical plan is passed to a query optimizer. This component analyzes the entire computational graph and applies a series of rule-based transformations to produce a more efficient, optimized plan. Key optimizations, inspired directly by Polars, will include:
 * Projection Pushdown: If the query ultimately only requires a subset of columns (e.g., df.filter(...).select(['a', 'c'])), the optimizer will push the column selection (select) operation down the plan, as close to the data source as possible. This ensures that only the necessary columns are ever read from storage or processed in intermediate steps, minimizing I/O and memory bandwidth usage.
 * Predicate Pushdown: Similarly, filtering operations (filter) are pushed down the plan. This allows data to be filtered out as early as possible, dramatically reducing the number of rows that need to be processed by subsequent, more expensive operations like joins or aggregations.
After optimization, the entire optimized logical plan is translated into a single, large, fused JAX function. This function is then passed to jax.jit and jax.shard_map for a single, efficient compilation and distributed execution. This approach aligns perfectly with JAX's execution model, which performs best when compiling large, complex functions where XLA can fuse many operations into a single, highly-optimized kernel. The lazy execution model is not merely an optional feature; it is the necessary and correct paradigm for building a high-performance DataFrame library on top of a JIT-compiled, functional framework.
Section 2: The JaxFrame Multi-Layered Architecture
To manage complexity and ensure modularity, the JaxFrame library will be structured using a multi-layered architecture. This design is adapted from the successful three-layer model employed by NVIDIA's cuDF, which separates the user-facing API, the internal data representation, and the low-level execution backend. In our JAX-native context, the C++/CUDA layer of cuDF is replaced by a physical execution layer that translates high-level operations into optimized JAX computations for TPUs.
2.1 The API Layer: The User-Facing JaxFrame
This is the highest level of the architecture, providing the primary interface for the user. It is designed for ease of use and familiarity for those accustomed to pandas, while strictly adhering to the functional principles established in Section 1.
 * Structure: The primary object at this layer is the JaxFrame class. Internally, it can be conceptualized as a dictionary-like container that maps string column names to instances of a JaxSeries class. Each JaxSeries object, in turn, is a wrapper around a core jax.Array that holds the column's numerical data. As detailed in Section 1.2, this entire composite object (JaxFrame containing JaxSeries objects) will be registered with JAX as a single, cohesive PyTree. This allows the entire structure to be treated as a unified entity by JAX's transformations.
 * Functionality: The API layer exposes a rich set of methods that mirror the pandas API for common data manipulation tasks. This includes operations like df.groupby('key').agg(...), df.join(other, on='key'), column selection via df['col_name'], and element-wise arithmetic through overloaded operators (+, -, *, /).
 * Lazy Operation: A critical feature of this layer is its lazy nature. Invoking a method on a JaxFrame instance does not trigger any computation on the underlying JAX arrays. Instead, it interacts with the Logical Plan Layer, constructing and appending a new node to the query plan. For example, calling df.filter(df['a'] > 0) would create a FilterNode in the logical plan, containing the expression col('a') > 0. The method then returns a new JaxFrame object that is linked to this updated logical plan. The actual data remains untouched until an action like .collect() is called.
2.2 The Logical Plan Layer: An Intermediate Representation
This layer forms the "brains" of the library, sitting between the user-facing API and the JAX execution backend. It is responsible for representing, validating, and optimizing the user's intended computation before it is ever sent to the compiler.
 * Structure: The logical plan is a data structure, typically a tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG), that represents the sequence of high-level DataFrame operations. The leaves of this tree are data sources (e.g., a ScanParquetNode or a FromArraysNode), and subsequent nodes represent transformations like Filter, Project (column selection), Aggregate, and Join. A key feature of this plan is that it is schema-aware. At every node, the plan maintains the schema (column names and their JAX dtypes) of the intermediate DataFrame. This allows for early and informative validation. For instance, if a user attempts to select a column that does not exist, the error can be raised immediately when the logical plan is constructed, rather than failing midway through a long-running computation, a powerful feature adopted from Polars.
 * Query Optimizer: The central component of this layer is the query optimizer. Before the physical execution layer can translate the plan into JAX code, the logical plan is passed through a series of transformation passes. Each pass rewrites the plan to be more computationally efficient without changing the final result. The initial implementation will focus on the two most impactful optimizations:
   * Projection Pushdown: This pass traverses the plan, identifying the minimum set of columns required to produce the final output. It then pushes the Project node as far down the tree as possible, ideally directly into the data scanning node. This prevents the system from ever loading or materializing columns that are ultimately discarded.
   * Predicate Pushdown: This pass moves Filter nodes as close to the data source as possible. Filtering data early is one of the most effective ways to improve performance, as it reduces the volume of data that subsequent, more expensive operations (like joins and sorts) need to process.
   * Operation Fusion: While JAX's JIT compiler is excellent at fusing low-level operations, the logical plan can facilitate this at a higher level. For example, a sequence of element-wise operations ((df['a'] * 2) + df['b']) can be represented as a single ExpressionNode, which is then translated into a single JAX function for optimal fusion by XLA.
2.3 The Physical Execution Layer: JAX and shard_map
This layer is the bridge between the abstract, optimized logical plan and the concrete, parallel execution on TPUs. Its sole responsibility is to translate the final, optimized logical plan into a single, JIT-compilable JAX function and orchestrate its execution.
 * Translation: The physical execution layer traverses the optimized logical plan and generates a corresponding pure Python function that uses JAX primitives. For example, a Filter node would be translated into a boolean mask and an array indexing operation (array[mask]). An Aggregate node following a GroupBy might be translated into a call to a parallel sort followed by a segmented sum. The goal is to compose all operations from the plan into one large function.
 * Execution Primitive: The primary tool for orchestrating distributed execution is jax.shard_map. The entire translated JAX function is wrapped in jax.shard_map, which handles the Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) execution across all available TPU devices. This layer is responsible for defining the device Mesh and the appropriate in_specs and out_specs to control how data is sharded and results are reassembled, as will be detailed in the next section.
 * Data Representation: At this level, the abstract concept of a JaxFrame is materialized as its physical representation: a PyTree of sharded JAX arrays. These arrays are physically distributed across the memory of the TPU devices according to the sharding specification. The execution layer manages the mapping between the logical column names from the plan and their corresponding physical, sharded jax.Array representations, feeding them into the shard_mapped function.
Section 3: Distributed Computation Across TPUs
Achieving scalable performance on a multi-TPU system requires a deliberate and explicit strategy for data and computation distribution. JaxFrame will leverage JAX's modern explicit parallelism APIs, which provide fine-grained control over how data is laid out across devices and how those devices communicate. This approach, centered on the shard_map transformation, allows for the implementation of sophisticated parallel algorithms that can fully exploit the high-bandwidth interconnects of TPU pods.
3.1 The shard_map Execution Model
The foundational primitive for all parallel execution in JaxFrame will be jax.shard_map. This transformation is an evolution of JAX's earlier parallelism APIs like pmap, offering greater expressiveness, performance, and composability. It is the recommended API for explicit, user-controlled SPMD-style parallelism. The shard_map model involves three key concepts:
 * SPMD Paradigm: shard_map executes the same function (the "program") on multiple devices simultaneously, but each device operates on a different piece (a "shard") of the data. This is the essence of the Single Program, Multiple Data model. The function passed to shard_map is written from the perspective of a single device, operating on its local shard of data.
 * Device Mesh: The first step in any distributed computation is to define the physical topology of the available hardware. This is accomplished using jax.make_mesh, which creates a logical grid of devices and assigns names to the grid's axes. For example, on a TPU v4 pod with 4096 chips, one might define a 2D mesh like mesh = jax.make_mesh((128, 32), ('data_parallel_axis', 'model_parallel_axis')). This mesh provides a coordinate system for placing and partitioning data.
 * Sharding Specifications: The core of shard_map's expressiveness lies in its specification of data layout. This is controlled via the in_specs and out_specs arguments, which are PyTrees of PartitionSpec objects (typically aliased as P).
   * in_specs: This argument specifies how each input array to the mapped function should be partitioned. The PartitionSpec is a tuple that maps the dimensions of the array to the named axes of the device mesh. For a DataFrame operation, the most common sharding will be partitioning by row. If our JaxFrame has columns 'A' and 'B', and we wish to partition them across the 'data_parallel_axis', the in_specs might look like {'A': P('data_parallel_axis'), 'B': P('data_parallel_axis')}. This tells shard_map to slice each column array along its first (row) axis and distribute the slices to the devices along the 'data_parallel_axis' of the mesh. If a mesh axis is not mentioned for an array dimension (e.g., P('data_parallel_axis', None) for a 2D array), the data is replicated across that axis.
   * out_specs: This argument defines the inverse operation: how the outputs from each device's function execution should be reassembled into a final, logical sharded array. For a row-parallel operation that produces a row-parallel output, the out_specs would typically mirror the in_specs.
3.2 Data Representation: The Distributed PyTree
The combination of the PyTree and sharding concepts gives rise to the central data representation in JaxFrame: the Distributed PyTree.
 * Logical vs. Physical View: From the user's perspective, they interact with a single, logical JaxFrame object that represents their entire dataset. However, under the hood, this object is a PyTree whose leaves (the JAX arrays for each column) are not monolithic arrays on a single host. Instead, they are jax.Array objects with an associated Sharding that describes their physical distribution across the TPU device mesh. For a DataFrame with N rows distributed across D devices along a 'data' axis, each device physically holds only a slice of N/D rows for each column.
 * A JAX-Native Analogy to Dask: This architecture is a direct, compiler-integrated analogue to the model used by Dask DataFrames. In Dask, a logical DataFrame is a collection of many smaller, concrete pandas DataFrames, and a task graph managed by a Python scheduler coordinates operations on them. In JaxFrame, the logical JaxFrame is a collection of JAX array shards. The "task graph" is the JAX expression (jaxpr) generated by tracing the user's function, and the "scheduler" is the XLA compiler itself, which orchestrates the computation and communication across devices. This deep integration into the compiler allows for significantly more optimization and lower overhead than a library-level scheduler, promising higher performance.
3.3 A Lexicon of Collective Communications for DataFrame Operations
A key feature of shard_map is that it allows the code running on each device to communicate with its peers through explicit collective communication primitives, which are found in the jax.lax module. These collectives are the building blocks for implementing complex distributed algorithms. The physical execution layer will translate high-level DataFrame operations into JAX functions that use these primitives.
 * Global Aggregations (df.sum(), df.mean()): These are implemented as a two-stage process. First, each device computes the sum (or other aggregation) on its local shard of data. This is an embarrassingly parallel step. Second, the results from all devices are combined using an all-reduce collective. jax.lax.psum(local_sum, axis_name='data_parallel_axis') performs this, summing the local_sum value from every device along the specified mesh axis and broadcasting the final global sum back to every device.
 * Broadcasting and Replication: This is often handled implicitly by the in_specs. For example, in an operation like df['a'] * scalar_value, the scalar_value can be passed with an empty PartitionSpec, P(), which instructs JAX to replicate it on every device. This is the mechanism for broadcasting a small piece of data (like a configuration parameter or a small lookup table) to all workers.
 * Data Shuffling (for Joins and GroupBy): Many advanced algorithms require a "shuffle" phase where data is re-partitioned across devices based on the values in a key column. The primitive for this is jax.lax.all_to_all. This collective performs a distributed matrix transpose. For example, if data is partitioned by row across 8 devices, all_to_all can be used to re-partition it such that each device now holds a subset of rows based on the hash of a key column. This is the fundamental building block for distributed hash joins and hash-based aggregations, and can also be used for alignment in sort-merge joins.
 * Gathering Data to Host (df.collect()): To bring a distributed DataFrame back to a single array on the host machine for inspection or saving, jax.lax.all_gather can be used. This collective gathers the data shards from all devices along a specified mesh axis and concatenates them, resulting in every device holding a complete, replicated copy of the entire array. From there, the data can be copied from any single device back to the host CPU's memory.
By mapping the semantics of DataFrame operations onto this powerful lexicon of JAX collective primitives, JaxFrame can implement a wide range of distributed algorithms in a way that is both explicit and highly optimizable by the XLA compiler.
Section 4: A Guide to Implementing Core Parallel Algorithms
This section provides concrete, JAX-centric implementation strategies for the most computationally demanding DataFrame operations: sorting, grouping, and joining. The central thesis of this section is the "unification of sort": by developing a single, highly optimized, massively parallel sorting primitive, we can use it as the foundational building block for the other complex operations. This approach simplifies the overall architecture and leverages the strengths of TPUs for numerical computation. The user's constraint to only support numerical data types is the key enabler of this strategy.
4.1 Table: Mapping DataFrame Operations to JAX Primitives
The following table serves as a high-level blueprint, connecting the user-facing API methods to their underlying algorithmic strategy and the specific JAX primitives that will be used for their implementation. This provides a clear translation from the logical to the physical layer of the architecture.
| DataFrame Operation | Algorithmic Strategy | Primary JAX Primitives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| df['a'] + df['b'] | Element-wise Operation | jax.numpy operators (+, -, *, /) | Embarrassingly parallel. Executed per-shard within jax.shard_map. |
| df.sum(), df.mean() | Global Reduction | jax.lax.psum, jax.lax.pmean | Two-stage process: local reduction on each shard, followed by a global all-reduce collective. |
| df.sort_values('key') | Massively Parallel Radix Sort | Custom JAX implementation using jax.lax.psum and jax.lax.all_to_all | The cornerstone primitive of the library. See Section 4.2 for a detailed breakdown. |
| df.groupby('key').sum() | Sort-based GroupBy | parallel_radix_sort, jax.ops.segment_sum | Leverages the core sort primitive to create contiguous groups, then performs a highly efficient segmented reduction. See Section 4.3. |
| df.merge(other, on='key') | Parallel Sort-Merge Join | parallel_radix_sort (x2), Custom Merge Kernel | Reuses the core sort primitive on both tables, followed by an embarrassingly parallel local merge on each device. See Section 4.4. |
4.2 Parallel Sorting: Radix Sort on TPUs
For the specified domain of fixed-size numerical data (integers and floats), Radix Sort is the algorithm of choice. Unlike comparison-based algorithms like Quicksort or Mergesort which have O(N log N) complexity, Radix Sort operates in O(kN) time, where k is the number of digits (e.g., bytes in the key) and N is the number of elements. This linear time complexity makes it exceptionally well-suited for massively parallel hardware like GPUs and TPUs, where it has been shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance.
The implementation of a distributed Radix Sort in JAX will proceed in passes, iterating through the bits of the keys (e.g., 8 bits at a time for a 64-bit float). Each pass consists of the following steps, orchestrated within a jax.shard_mapped function:
 * Local Histogram Calculation: Each TPU core processes its local shard of the input array. It computes a histogram of the current "digit" (e.g., the values of the current byte) for all the elements it owns. This step is entirely local and requires no communication.
 * Global Histogram Aggregation: The local histograms from all devices must be combined to understand the global distribution of digits. This is a perfect use case for jax.lax.psum. The local histogram arrays are summed across all devices on the data-parallel mesh axis. The result is a global histogram, which is broadcast back to every device.
 * Global Offset Calculation: Using the global histogram, each device computes a global prefix sum (also known as an exclusive scan). This can be implemented efficiently in JAX using jax.lax.scan. The result of the scan gives the starting memory offset for each digit in the final sorted output array. For example, if there are 100 keys with digit 0 and 250 keys with digit 1, the scan will determine that keys with digit 0 will occupy indices 0-99, and keys with digit 1 will start at index 100.
 * Local Offset Calculation: Each device now scans its local histogram to determine the relative offset for each of its elements within a global digit bucket. For instance, if device 3 has five elements with digit 1, it knows their local offsets are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 * Data Scatter (Reordering): This is the shuffle step. Each device iterates through its local elements. For each element, it calculates its final destination address by adding the global offset for its digit (from step 3) to its local offset for that digit (from step 4). The data is then reordered across all devices. This complex communication pattern can be implemented efficiently using the jax.lax.all_to_all collective, which effectively performs a distributed transpose, sending each element to its new home on the correct device and at the correct position.
This entire process is repeated for each chunk of bits in the key, starting from the least significant bits and moving to the most significant. The stability of the counting sort-based pass ensures that the order established by previous passes is preserved, ultimately resulting in a fully sorted array distributed across all TPUs.
4.3 Parallel GroupBy and Aggregations: A Sort-Based Approach
While traditional database systems often use hash-based algorithms for GROUP BY operations , a sort-based approach offers superior synergy with the JaxFrame architecture. It directly leverages our most highly optimized primitive (parallel sort) and maps cleanly to JAX's array-centric, data-parallel primitives.
The implementation strategy is a two-step process:
 * Parallel Sort: The first and most crucial step is to sort the entire DataFrame based on the specified group-by key(s). This is performed using the massively parallel Radix Sort detailed in Section 4.2. The key columns are treated as the primary sort keys, and the value columns are "carried along," meaning they are permuted in the same way as the key columns to maintain row integrity. The result of this operation is a new, distributed JaxFrame where all rows belonging to the same group are now physically contiguous in memory across the devices.
 * Segmented Reduction: With the data sorted by key, the problem of aggregation is transformed into a segmented reduction problem. We first need to identify the boundaries of each group. This can be done in a data-parallel fashion by comparing adjacent key values on each device and across device boundaries. A simple comparison (keys[1:]!= keys[:-1]) yields a boolean mask indicating the start of a new segment. From this mask, an array of segment_ids can be constructed, where each element is assigned an integer ID corresponding to its group.
   With the value columns and the segment_ids array, we can now use JAX's highly optimized built-in segmented reduction operators: jax.ops.segment_sum, jax.ops.segment_max, jax.ops.segment_min, etc.. These functions are designed for exactly this use case and are implemented with efficient, low-level kernels on the accelerator. They perform the aggregation (e.g., sum) over all values that share the same segment ID. This step is extremely efficient and perfectly suited to the data-parallel nature of TPUs.
4.4 Parallel Joins: Sort-Merge Join
Consistent with the sort-centric design philosophy, the primary join strategy for JaxFrame will be a parallel sort-merge join. This approach again reuses the core parallel sort primitive, avoiding the need to implement and maintain a separate, complex distributed hash table infrastructure. The Massively Parallel Sort-Merge (MPSM) join algorithm provides a strong conceptual model, emphasizing the avoidance of a final, hard-to-parallelize global merge step by working on independently sorted runs.
The implementation follows a three-phase process:
 * Parallel Sort: Both the left and right DataFrames involved in the join are independently sorted based on their respective join keys. This is done using two separate invocations of the parallel Radix Sort primitive from Section 4.2.
 * Partition and Align (Optional but Recommended): After sorting, the data in both tables is ordered by key, but matching keys may reside on different devices. To enable a fully local merge in the next step, the data should be re-partitioned across the devices based on the range of key values. For example, a global histogram of keys can be computed to determine split points that will roughly balance the data. Then, an all_to_all collective can be used to shuffle the rows of both tables such that all rows with keys in a certain range (e.g., keys 0-1,000,000) are located on device 0, the next range on device 1, and so on. After this phase, we have a guarantee that if a key exists in both tables, its corresponding rows will be located on the same TPU device.
 * Local Merge: With both tables sorted and their key ranges aligned across the same devices, the final join step becomes embarrassingly parallel. Within the jax.shard_mapped function, each TPU core executes a standard, sequential merge-join algorithm on its local shards of the left and right tables. Since all matching keys are guaranteed to be on the same device, no further cross-device communication is required. Each device can produce its portion of the joined output independently. This final phase scales perfectly with the number of devices.
This sort-centric strategy unifies the implementation of the three most complex DataFrame operations. By investing engineering effort into a single, world-class parallel sorting algorithm, we gain highly performant, scalable, and architecturally consistent implementations for sorting, grouping, and joining, perfectly tailored to the capabilities of JAX and the TPU architecture.
Section 5: Phased Implementation Roadmap and Strategic Recommendations
This section outlines a practical, four-phase roadmap for the development of the JaxFrame library. The plan is designed to deliver value incrementally, starting with a minimal viable product and progressively adding layers of complexity and functionality. This approach allows for continuous testing and validation while managing the significant engineering challenges involved. The section concludes with strategic recommendations to guide the project's execution.
5.1 Phase 1: The Core Data Structure and Single-Device Eager API
 * Objective: To establish the fundamental data structures of the library and prove their basic functionality and integration with JAX on a single device. This phase focuses on correctness and core API design before tackling the complexities of distribution and optimization.
 * Tasks:
   * Implement JaxFrame and JaxSeries Classes: Create the core Python classes. The JaxFrame will manage a dictionary of column names to JaxSeries objects, and the JaxSeries will wrap a jax.Array.
   * Register as a JAX PyTree: Implement the tree_flatten and tree_unflatten methods for both classes and register them using jax.tree_util.register_pytree_node. This is the most critical task of this phase, as it ensures JAX compatibility.
   * Implement Eager API: Develop a subset of the pandas-like API for basic operations. This will include element-wise arithmetic (e.g., df['a'] + df['b']) and simple reductions (e.g., df.sum()). These methods should operate eagerly, immediately calling the corresponding jax.numpy functions and wrapping them with jax.jit for single-device compilation.
 * Milestone: A developer can successfully create a JaxFrame from a dictionary of NumPy or JAX arrays, perform simple, JIT-compiled calculations on it, and receive a new JaxFrame as a result, all running on a single CPU, GPU, or TPU core. The object should work correctly when passed through a simple jax.jit-decorated function.
5.2 Phase 2: The Distributed Engine and shard_map
 * Objective: To enable multi-device computation for the simple, element-wise operations developed in Phase 1. This phase introduces the core concepts of distributed data and computation.
 * Tasks:
   * Integrate Sharding API: Expose functionality for users to define a jax.make_mesh and a NamedSharding object, and use them to create a distributed JaxFrame via jax.device_put.
   * Build Core Physical Execution Layer: Create the internal machinery that takes a simple JAX function (e.g., one that performs element-wise addition) and wraps it in jax.shard_map. This will involve programmatically generating the in_specs and out_specs based on the sharding of the input JaxFrame.
   * Implement Distributed Reductions: Extend the eager API for reductions like .sum() to use the two-stage local-sum/jax.lax.psum pattern within the shard_mapped function.
 * Milestone: A user can create a JaxFrame that is sharded by row across all available TPU devices. They can execute element-wise operations and full-table reductions on this distributed DataFrame and observe near-linear performance scaling with the number of devices.
5.3 Phase 3: Advanced Parallel Algorithms
 * Objective: To implement the complex, performance-critical algorithms for sorting, grouping, and joining, which form the heart of a functional DataFrame library.
 * Tasks:
   * Implement Massively Parallel Radix Sort: This is the highest-priority and most complex task of this phase. Following the strategy outlined in Section 4.2, implement a JAX-native, distributed Radix Sort that operates on sharded JAX arrays using a combination of local histograms and global collectives (psum, all_to_all).
   * Implement Sort-Based GroupBy: Build the groupby().agg() functionality. This will involve creating a pipeline that first calls the new parallel sort primitive to group keys, then identifies segment boundaries, and finally calls JAX's segmented reduction operators (jax.ops.segment_sum, etc.) as described in Section 4.3.
   * Implement Parallel Sort-Merge Join: Build the .merge() or .join() method. This will reuse the Radix Sort primitive to sort both input tables, followed by an optional alignment step and a final, embarrassingly parallel local merge on each device, per the design in Section 4.4.
 * Milestone: The library now supports the three most computationally intensive and essential DataFrame operations in a distributed, scalable manner. The core analytical capabilities of the library are now in place.
5.4 Phase 4: The Lazy API and Query Optimizer
 * Objective: To transition from an eager execution model to a lazy, query-optimizing model to unlock maximum performance and efficiency.
 * Tasks:
   * Develop Logical Plan Representation: Define the data structures for the logical plan nodes (Scan, Filter, Project, Aggregate, Join, etc.).
   * Refactor API to be Lazy: Modify the public API methods from Phase 1 and 3. Instead of executing computations, they will now construct and return a new JaxFrame object pointing to an updated logical plan tree.
   * Implement Query Optimizer: Write the transformation passes that operate on the logical plan. The initial focus should be on implementing predicate pushdown and projection pushdown.
   * Implement .collect() Trigger: Create the .collect() method. This method will invoke the query optimizer on the current logical plan, trigger the physical execution layer to translate the optimized plan into a JAX function, and then execute it via jax.shard_map.
 * Milestone: The library is now feature-complete from an architectural standpoint. It offers users a high-level, expressive API that automatically optimizes their queries for efficient, distributed execution on TPUs.
5.5 Final Recommendations
 * Prioritize the Parallel Sort: The success and performance of the entire library are disproportionately dependent on a high-quality, robust, and heavily optimized implementation of the parallel Radix Sort. This single component enables efficient sorting, grouping, and joining. It should be allocated the most significant and skilled engineering resources.
 * Embrace the Functional API: Resist the temptation to perfectly replicate the mutable, in-place behaviors of the pandas API. Doing so would fight against the grain of JAX and lead to a complex, inefficient, and bug-prone implementation. Instead, lean into the functional, immutable paradigm. The API contract should be clear and well-documented, educating users on the out-of-place semantics and the benefits this provides in a parallel environment.
 * Benchmark Relentlessly: From Phase 2 onwards, establish a rigorous and continuous benchmarking suite. Performance should be measured against a single-TPU-core baseline to validate scaling efficiency. The benchmarks should be designed to identify communication bottlenecks, inefficient sharding strategies, and JIT compilation overhead.
 * Start with a Narrow Focus: The user's initial decision to exclude non-numeric and variable-length data types (like strings) is a critical strategic advantage. Adhere to this constraint strictly throughout the initial development phases. Support for more complex types would require a fundamentally different data representation (likely based on Apache Arrow, similar to cuDF ) and would represent a monumental increase in complexity. It should be considered a separate, long-term project to be undertaken only after the core numerical engine is mature and proven.
